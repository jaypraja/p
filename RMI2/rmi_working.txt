Compile the Java Files:

1.  Open CMD.
Navigate to the directory where your Java files (RMIServerInterface.java, RMIServer.java, RMIClient.java) are saved using the cd command. 
For example:

--cd path\to\your\directory

Compile the Java files using the javac command:

--javac RMIServerInterface.java RMIServer.java RMIClient.java


Start the RMI Registry:
In the same CMD window, start the RMI registry using the rmiregistry command:


--rmiregistry

Leave this CMD window open. The registry will continue to run until you close this window.

Run the RMI Server:

Open a new CMD window.

Navigate to the directory where your compiled server class file (RMIServer.class) is located.
Run the server using the java command:

--java RMIServer

This command will start the RMI server and bind it to the RMI registry.

Run the RMI Client:

Open another new CMD window.

Navigate to the directory where your compiled client class file (RMIClient.class) is located.

Run the client using the java command:

--java RMIClient
This command will execute the RMI client, which will connect to the RMI server, invoke a method, and print the response.

Observe Output:
You should see output indicating that the server has started successfully in the window where you started the server.

In the window where you ran the client, you should see the message received from the server printed to the console.
Close the Applications:
Once you're done testing, you can close all CMD windows to terminate the RMI registry, server, and client.
